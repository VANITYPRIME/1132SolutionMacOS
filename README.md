# If you still get 1132 after clearing the text in the files.




--Go to the Finder and search for zoom.us and make sure there are  not multiple 
  copies of the app in your system. If there are remove them and go back to the 
  data file and clear the file(s) text, save and launch zoom.
  
-- Open finder, navigate to the MacintoshHD. double Click the HD and open it. Press
   command+shift+ . to show hidden files.
   click on Users, then your name, look for the library folder that is transparent and 
   open it
   Open the Application Support Folder and find the Folder for zoom and open it. 
   Clear the data text files with TextEditor and save. LAunch zoom.
   
   
***** Some people have told me they have to launch Zoom via the finder and NOT the
Launchpad... not sure why that works but you can also try that.
